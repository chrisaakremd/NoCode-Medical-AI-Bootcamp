# NoCode-Medical-AI-Bootcamp

A 2 week, no-code AI boot camp for clinicians. **No coding required!**

### Objectives

- By the end of the rotation, learners will demonstrate an understanding of how machine learning and artificial intelligence can be integrated into a clinical research through analysis of curated projects utilizing structured data, natural language, and imaging in the medical literature.
- By the end of the rotation, learners will complete assigned artificial intelligence and machine learning modules and apply new knowledge and skills towards answering selected demonstration problems.
