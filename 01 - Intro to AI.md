# Introduction to AI
## What is artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence is a complex topic with much promise in medical practice and research. The goal of this bootcamp is to jump into the world of artificial intelligence and deep learning, gain exposure to key topics, and give you the information needed to generate ideas for applying AI to clinical practice and research.
### Brief overview
This course's content is an aggregation of free online courses from AI education leaders such as Coursera, Deeplearning.ai, Edureka, University of Helsinki, and select literature from PubMed. 

Completion of the Coursera/Deeplearning.ai course takes about 7 hours total to complete and comes with a shareable certificate at completion.
- Deeplearning.ai has 5 additional specialization courses available through Coursera for those with interest in learning how to program these models.

Completion of the Elements of AI course takes about 6-10 hours total, including exercises. A sharable certificate is available at completion. 
- An intermediate level **'Building AI'** course is also available through Elements of AI. We will be using portions of this course in this bootcamp. A certificate, if desired, can be purchased with completion of the entire course.  

Completion of the Coursera 'Managing Machine Learning Projects with Google Cloud' course, a non-technical course targeting business professionals (clinicians too!) that will be directing ML projects. 

[Fast.ai](http://fast.ai) is a popular, free resource for learning deep learning, natural language processing, and machine learning. However, this course emphasizes a **code first** teaching philosophy. 
- If you have previous experience with writing code (even if only a little) and want to learn more about coding neural networks in python, this resource is a great start!

## The language of AI
Many technical tools and programming languages are used by data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers to implement machine learning algorithms. 

#### Languages
Many languages are used for artificial intelligence applications. Python is popular because of the simple code syntax, however it can be slower or less memory efficient than other languages in the list below. For educational purposes, most learning material uses either python or R. 
- [Python](https://www.python.org) - Most popular
- [R](https://www.r-project.org)
- [Java](https://www.java.com)
- [Scala](https://scala-lang.org)
- [Julia](https://julialang.org)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
- [Go](https://golang.org)

#### Frameworks and libraries
In AI papers, you may run across some of these libraries and frameworks.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) - Python data analysis library.
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org) - Library for matrix and tensor operations.  
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - Classical machine learning framework.
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) - Deep learning framework.
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) - Deep learning framework.
- [PyTorch-lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai) - PyTorch-based high-level deep learning framework.
- [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) - PyTorch-based high level deep learning framework.
- [MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org) - Deep learning framework.
- [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) - High performance deep learning library for python.
- [ONNX](https://onnx.ai) - High performance open standard neural networks. Used for implementation. 
- [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers) - State of the art NLP library.
- [spaCy](https://spacy.io) - NLP framework for python.
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org) - NLP framework for python.

**Learning how to use each of these tools is beyond the scope of this course**, but if you are interested, many excellent tutorials on programming languages and advanced AI/ML topics can be found and accessed for free through Mayo Clinic's license for [Udemy for business](http://mayoclinic.udemy.com).
