## What is artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence is a complex topic with much promise in medical practice and research. The goal of this bootcamp is to jump into the world of artificial intelligence and deep learning, gain exposure to key topics, and give you the information needed to generate ideas for applying AI to clinical practice and research.

## The language of AI
Many technical tools and programming languages are used by data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers to implement machine learning algorithms.
